# Coarse

A CLI application written in C to teach and test Morse Code. I wanted to learn
Morse Code for a while, so I thought I'd just write a program to help me out.

Unfinished; it's quite basic at the moment. Potential for including spaced
repetition algorithms in the future.

## Build & Run

```sh
make && ./main
```
